can I assume the client is on the ethereum network ALWAYS?
I need oracle to handle emit to call user to get ticket, right?
Push notification is centralized? Yes, as always.
how big is uTicket and rTicket respectively anyways?
should've just passed along as event and only in memory.
saves LOADS in gas.
but that requires client side.
cache ticket client side maybe? refresh when manually required.
use oracle to listen to events and create push notification to client, then let client use getPastLogs to retrive "actual" ticket.
retrive ticket with web3.getPastLogs then filter?
is it commercially feasible to store both ticket on chain (and pass along?)
